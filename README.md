# PDF OCR Extraction Tool

This Python script extracts text from a PDF file using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and saves the results as both a Word document and an Excel file. It processes a specified number of pages, converts them to images, applies OCR, cleans the extracted text, and organizes the output into structured formats.

## Features
- Converts PDF pages to high-resolution images (300 DPI) using PyMuPDF.
- Performs OCR on images using EasyOCR, supporting English and Bengali languages.
- Cleans extracted text by merging short lines, removing Arabic text, and eliminating empty lines.
- Splits text into columns (Title and Description) based on delimiters (`:` or `-`).
- Saves extracted text to a Word document (`Output.docx`) with page headings.
- Saves structured data to an Excel file (`Output.xlsx`) with page numbers and categorized columns.

## Prerequisites
To run this script, ensure you have Python installed along with the following dependencies:
- `PyMuPDF` (for PDF processing)
- `easyocr` (for OCR)
- `python-docx` (for Word document creation)
- `pandas` (for Excel output)
- `tqdm` (for progress bars)
- `regex` (for text cleaning)

Install the dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install PyMuPDF easyocr python-docx pandas tqdm
```
or

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



Additionally, ensure you have a PDF file named `book.pdf` in the same directory as the script or update the `INPUT_PDF` path in the configuration.

## Configuration
The script uses the following configuration variables, defined at the top of the script:
- `INPUT_PDF`: Path to the input PDF file (default: `book.pdf`).
- `OUTPUT_DIR`: Directory to store output files (default: `output`).
- `PAGES_TO_CONVERT`: Number of pages to process (default: 20).

Modify these variables as needed before running the script.

## Usage
1. Place the input PDF file (`book.pdf`) in the script's directory or update the `INPUT_PDF` path.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. The script will:
   - Create an `output` directory with subfolders `images`, `word`, and `excel`.
   - Convert the specified number of PDF pages to PNG images.
   - Perform OCR on the images to extract text.
   - Clean and process the text, removing Arabic lines and merging short lines.
   - Save the extracted text to `output/word/Output.docx`.
   - Save structured data to `output/excel/Output.xlsx`.

## Output
- **Images**: PNG files for each processed page are saved in `output/images/` (e.g., `page_01.png`, `page_02.png`, etc.).
- **Word Document**: A file named `Output.docx` in `output/word/` contains the extracted text, organized by page with bold headings.
- **Excel File**: A file named `Output.xlsx` in `output/excel/` contains a table with columns:
  - `PageNumber`: The page number from the PDF.
  - `Title`: The text before a delimiter (`:` or `-`) or the full paragraph if no delimiter is present.
  - `Description`: The text after a delimiter, if present.
  - `FullText`: The complete paragraph text.

## Text Cleaning
The script includes a `clean_text` function that:
- Removes empty lines.
- Skips lines containing Arabic text (based on Unicode ranges).
- Merges short lines (less than 50 characters) to form coherent paragraphs.
- Strips extra whitespace.

The `split_columns` function organizes text into `Title` and `Description` columns if a delimiter (`:` or `-`) is present, facilitating structured output in the Excel file.

## Notes
- The script processes only the first `PAGES_TO_CONVERT` pages of the PDF or the total number of pages if fewer are available.
- EasyOCR is configured for English and Bengali (`['bn', 'en']`). Modify the `easyocr.Reader` languages if needed.
- Arabic text is filtered out using a regular expression to avoid irrelevant content. Adjust the `arabic_re` pattern for other languages if required.
- Ensure sufficient disk space for image files, as high-resolution PNGs can be large.
- The script assumes the input PDF is readable and not encrypted.

## Example
For a PDF named `book.pdf` with 20 pages:
1. The script converts pages 1â€“20 to PNG images in `output/images/`.
2. OCR extracts text, which is cleaned and organized into paragraphs.
3. A Word document (`Output.docx`) is created with page-wise text.
4. An Excel file (`Output.xlsx`) is created with structured data, e.g.:

| PageNumber | Title          | Description           | FullText                     |
|------------|----------------|-----------------------|------------------------------|
| 1          | Chapter 1      | Introduction to...    | Chapter 1: Introduction to...|
| 1          | Section 1.1    | Overview of...        | Section 1.1 - Overview of... |

## Troubleshooting
- **PDF not found**: Ensure the `INPUT_PDF` path is correct and the file exists.
- **OCR errors**: Verify that EasyOCR is properly installed and the language models (`bn`, `en`) are downloaded.
- **Memory issues**: Reduce `PAGES_TO_CONVERT` or lower the DPI in `page.get_pixmap(dpi=300)` for large PDFs.
- **Output issues**: Check write permissions for the `OUTPUT_DIR` and its subfolders.
